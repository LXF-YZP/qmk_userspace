# Alternate Hold keymap

This is an example keymap which implements a trackpad gesture. It is an alternative to the tap hold gesture used for drag and drop. Instead while moving the pointer, you tap with a second finger to activate/deactivate the held left mouse button.

The optional HOLD_LOCK macro can be used to keep the button held even when you have no fingers on the trackpad. In this case you need to repeat the gesture (put the first finger down and tap the second finger), to release the button.
